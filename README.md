# Face_mask_detection
This project detects face mask usage using a CNN model trained on mask and no mask images. It classifies images and performs real-time mask detection using a webcam. The system detects faces using OpenCV's Haar Cascade and predicts whether the person is wearing a mask or not, displaying the result on the screen.
